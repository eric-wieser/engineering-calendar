	Accessing the rota files for editing.
	</h2>
	<p>
		You will need access to the fileserver where the excel files are located.  To do this you need to be a member of AD\labcal-access and then mount the labcals directory from your PC.  Please contact the helpdesk for these to be setup.

	Creating a lab rota for next year.
	</h2>
	<p>
	In the staging area (windows mount \\cued-fs\lab-cals\staging-current\engineering-calendar) copy the excel spreadsheet from last year and save, incrementing the year in its filename. The test/staging pages (http://teach-cals.eng.cam.ac.uk/staging/cued-labs) should now include the new lab rota. Once the various alterations have been made to this rota (by editing the excel spreadsheet) and you are happy with the printout and other views the Excel file can be copied into the 'live' directory location. IT support is required to create a symbolic link so that the page appears in the 'live' copy as well as checking the excel file into the version control system. Contact IT support for this, once it has been done the new rota will become available in the 'live' pages.

	Editing the content of the rota.
	</h2>
	<p>
	Some basic (mainly untested) notes on modifying the lab rota. Note: It is best to edit the file in the staging directory and once happy with the results copy across into the 'live' directory.
	<ul>
		<li>Dates can be modified by updating the fields in the excel spreadsheet ('mich' or 'lent' tabs in the sheet).</li>
		<li>(Untested) New Labs can be added by adding rows to the correct key section on the 'labs' tab.</li>
		<li>Key descriptions can be modified by editing the relevant row in the 'labs' tab.</li>
		<li>(Untested) Slots (start end times) can be added by adding an entry in the 'slots' tab then referencing in the 'labs' tab.</li>

	Undoing your changes.
	</h2>
	<p>
		The Excel files are located on a fileserver which is backed-up regularly.  If you make changes in the Excel file but then decide you need to go back to a previous version you might be able to access the old version by (on windows) right clicking on the Excel file choose the 'properties' section in the popup screen (at the bottom) and then select the 'Previous Versions' tab. Select the version you wish to revert back to (if any are available) and click 'Restore'. When doing this you might want to take a copy of your file first before restoring.
